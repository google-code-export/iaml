=Introduction=

Composite Operations are operations which are composed of [IamlOperations smaller operations]. IAML defines a number of pre-defined composite operations which automatically generate their contents (unless [IamlInference the generation is disabled]). Their intent is based on their _name_, and we summarise these operations below.

The current implementation of these operations are implemented in the Drools rule files  [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/trunk/org.openiaml.model.drools/rules/operations.drl#52 operations.drl]. They are also implemented in [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/trunk/org.openiaml.model.drools/rules/sessions.drl sessions.drl] temporarily, but this needs to be refactored out (TODO).

*Also see* [IamlPrimitiveOperations] for an overview of the pre-defined operation components.

This will set the [IamlApplicationElementProperties _fieldValue_ of the containing object] to a particular value (the incoming parameter).
