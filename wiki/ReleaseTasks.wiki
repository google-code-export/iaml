=Releasing a new plugin version=

This page briefly describes the steps involved with releasing a new plugin version. Ideally in the future this will be part of an [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=37 automated release script].

Given that we want to upgrade the plugin to a new version number:

  # For each .gmfgen,
    # Update _Editor Generator/Plugin/Version_ to the new version
    # Regenerate diagram code
  # Diff all _plugin/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_ and replace _Bundle-Vendor: %providerName_ with _Bundle-Vendor: www.openiaml.org_
  # Update the _MANIFEST.MF_ in all other plugins
  # Run all unit tests, especially those in _ReleaseTestsSuite_ and _ModelTestsSuite_
  # Commit changes to SVN
  # Update the feature.xml and site.xml (instructions to be continued)
