=Model 0.5.1=

*Released [http://journals.jevon.org/users/jevon-phd/entry/19824 April 2010]*

This adds support for OpenID and RSS feeds. There has also been a lot of metamodel refactoring, to clean up the metamodel. Many [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone-Release0.5.1 issues have been fixed].

==New Data Types==

===iamlOpenID===

A URL that is an OpenID URL. This is always valid on the client-side, but only valid on the server-side once the user has authenticated with the given URL. This follows the specifications in [http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html OpenID v1.1]; for example, it supports delegating URLs.

When rendered as an [http://openiaml.org/model/InputTextField InputTextField], an "Authenticate" button is provided, which will allow the server to authenticate the user.

==Changed Elements==

===Frame===

A [http://openiaml.org/model/Frame Frame] can now have different rendering targets. By default, it will generate HTML.

If the rendering target is set to RSS2_0, then the content will be rendered as a [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html RSS 2.0 feed] instead. This is achieved by iterating over any [http://openiaml.org/model/DomainIterator DomainIterators] in the frame.

===EntryGate===

An [http://openiaml.org/model/EntryGate EntryGate] can now require a Label to be set (and valid) within the same Scope. For example, if the Label is of type `iamlOpenID`, then the user must provide and authenticate a valid OpenID URL before the Scope can be accessed.
