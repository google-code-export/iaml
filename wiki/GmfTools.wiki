=Introduction=

I have made a very simple and basic extension which resolves Eclipse bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=283775: Generate Diagram Code for multiple .gmfgens.

You can install it from the update site below.

{{{
Name: IAML GMF Tools Update Site
URL: http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.gmf.tools.update/
}}}

It uses internal GMF code, so it will likely break in a later GMF version, but this will have to suffice until the bug is resolved :)
