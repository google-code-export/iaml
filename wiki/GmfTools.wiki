=Introduction=

I have made a very simple and basic extension which resolves Eclipse bug *[https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=283775 283775: Generate Diagram Code for multiple .gmfgens]*.

You can install it from the update site below.

{{{
Name: IAML GMF Tools Update Site
URL: http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.gmf.tools.update/
}}}

Once installed, you can select any number of .gmfgen files, and select "Generate multiple diagram code". It will cycle through each file and generate the code as normal.

It uses internal GMF code, so it will likely break in a later GMF version, but this will have to suffice until the bug is resolved :)
