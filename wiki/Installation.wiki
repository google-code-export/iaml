=Introduction=

The IAML plugin is an Eclipse plugin that provides a visual editor for the modelling of Internet applications, as an implementation of our [http://openiaml.org research project]. Following our research emphasis on iterative development, we hope that regularly releasing our plugin will help us focus development and gain valuable feedback from the development community.

=Requirements=

*Currently the plugin only supports Eclipse 3.3 (Europa) and GMF 2.0.1.*

  # Eclipse 3.3 Europa
