#labels Featured

=Introduction=

The IAML plugin is an Eclipse plugin that provides a visual editor for the modelling of Internet applications, as an implementation of our [http://openiaml.org research project]. Following our research emphasis on iterative development, we hope that regularly releasing our plugin will help us focus development and gain valuable feedback from the development community.

=Requirements=

*Currently the plugin only supports Eclipse 3.3 (Europa) and GMF 2.0.2, until [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&bug_file_loc_type=allwordssubstr&bug_file_loc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=allwords&keywords=&bug_severity=blocker&bug_severity=critical&bug_severity=major&emailassigned_to1=1&emailreporter1=1&emailqa_contact1=1&emaillongdesc1=1&emailtype1=exact&email1=jevon%40jevon.org&emailtype2=substring&email2=&bugidtype=include&bug_id=&votes=&chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0= some bugs] are fixed.*

These requirements may be installed through the [http://download.eclipse.org/releases/europa/ Europa update site]. (They also might be installed with the installation process.)

=Installation=

  # In Eclipse, select _Help_ > _Software Updates_ > _Find and Install..._
  # Add the following remote site:
{{{
    Name: IAML Plugin
    URL:  http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.update/
}}}
  # Select the _IAML Modelling Platform_ feature to install
  # Once it has been installed, restart Eclipse

Now that you have got the IAML plugin installed, you can run through the [Tutorial] to learn how to use the plugin to generate your first modelled Internet application:

  # Create a new blank project
  # Create a new IAML model by selecting _New..._ > _Examples_ > _Iaml Diagram_
  # You can now edit the _iaml_diagram_ to create your Internet application visually
