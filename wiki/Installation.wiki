#summary How to install releases of the IAML Eclipse Plugin
#labels Featured

=Introduction=

The IAML plugin is an Eclipse plugin that provides a visual editor for the modelling of Internet applications, as an implementation of our [http://openiaml.org research project]. Following our research emphasis on iterative development, we hope that regularly releasing our plugin will help us focus development and gain valuable feedback from the development community.

=Requirements=

*Currently the plugin only supports Eclipse 3.3 (Europa) and GMF 2.0.2, until [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=50 issue 50] is resolved.*

  # Eclipse 3.3 Europa
    * _plus UML 2.0 feature for OAW_
  # GMF 2.0.2
  # [http://www.eclipse.org/gmt/oaw/download/ OpenArchitectureWare 4.3]
    * Update site: http://www.openarchitectureware.org/updatesite/milestone/site.xml
  # [http://code.google.com/p/iacleaner/ iacleaner 0.2]
    * Update site: http://iacleaner.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.iacleaner.update/site.xml

For testing:

  # [http://www.eclipticalsoftware.com/emf/xpath/ XPath Support for EMF]
    * Update site: http://www.eclipticalsoftware.com/updates

These requirements may be installed through the [http://download.eclipse.org/releases/europa/ Europa update site]. (They also might be installed with the installation process.)

=Installation=

  # In Eclipse, select _Help_ > _Software Updates_ > _Find and Install..._
  # Add the following remote site:
{{{
Name: IAML Plugin
URL:  http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/org.openiaml.update/
}}}
  # Select the _IAML Modelling Platform_ feature to install
  # Once it has been installed, restart Eclipse

Now that you have got the IAML plugin installed, you can run through the [Tutorial] to learn how to use the plugin to generate your first modelled Internet application:

  # Create a new blank project
  # Create a new IAML model by selecting _New..._ > _Examples_ > _Iaml Diagram_
  # You can now edit the _iaml_diagram_ to create your Internet application visually
