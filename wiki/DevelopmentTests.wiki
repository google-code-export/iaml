=Introduction=

The IAML project comes with a comprehensive suite of unit, acceptance and integration test cases, which need to all pass before a new plugin version can be released.

There are currently two test suites, that must be run individually until [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=31 issue 31] is resolved:

  # [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/trunk/org.openiaml.model.tests/src/org/openiaml/model/tests/AllTests.java AllTests.java]: code generation, inference, model quality, release quality
  # [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/trunk/org.openiaml.model.tests/src/org/openiaml/model/tests/eclipse/EclipseTestsSuite.java EclipseTestsSuite.java]: run-time plugin tests

All new tests will be added to one of the test suites above. In the future testing will be added as an [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=26 automated testing script].
