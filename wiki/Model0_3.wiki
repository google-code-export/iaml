==Sessions==
|| *Description* || ApplicationElementProperties stored within a Session (i.e. text field values, login keys) are only available to a single session user. When the session is closed, the values are lost. ||

==Operation/Condition Modelling (2)==

*Temporary Variables*
|| *Description* || Within operation or condition modelling, these represent temporary variables. When the operation is finished, the values will have been lost. ||

*Execution Flow*
|| *Description* || Within operation or condition modelling, the _execution flow_ models the order in which operations are executed. If an operation has multiple outwards ExecutionEdges, they are run in series (ideally they would be parallel). ||

*Data Flow*
|| *Description* || Within operation or condition modelling, the _data flow_ models the flow of dat between elements; for example, from a parameter to a temporary variable, or as a parameter to an operation. ||

*Start Node*
|| *Description* || An operation or condition starts at the start node. ||

*Finish Node*
|| *Description* || An operation completes at the finish node. In conditions, this means the condition has passed. ||

*Cancel Node*
|| *Description* || If the operation has not completed successfully, then the cancel node acts as a failure or exception-throwing element. The value provided is the exception message thrown. In conditions, this means the condition has failed. ||
