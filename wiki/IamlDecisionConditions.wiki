=Introduction=

*[http://openiaml.org/model/DecisionCondition Decision Conditions]* are the fundamental building blocks of conditional blocks. Their intent is based on their _name_, and we summarise these operations below.

Decision conditions have a fixed semantics and cannot be changed (without modifying IAML inference and code generation logic).

*Also see* [IamlCompositeOperations] for an overview of pre-defined composite operations, and [IamlPrimitiveOperations] for an overview of the fundamental operations.

This condition will be *true* if the incoming data flow variable has been set, *false* if not. For example, incoming properties stored within a session that have not been modified will return *false*. It only accepts incoming [ApplicationElementProperty]s.

==equal?==

This condition will be *true* if *all* incoming [DataFlow]s have the same value.

==true?==

This condition will be *true* if *all* incoming [DataFlow]s can be considered true:

  * boolean true (although types aren't implemented yet)
  * "true"
  * any string not equal to "0", "" or "false"
  * a non-zero integer
  * any floating-point number not equal to 0.0

This is similiar to the [http://nz2.php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php conversion of booleans in PHP].
