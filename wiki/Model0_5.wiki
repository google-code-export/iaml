=Model 0.4.1=

*Released [http://journals.jevon.org/users/jevon-phd/entry/19777 December 2009]*

This is a minor release which changes the approach used in the code generation of operations. Instead of generating operations as an exhaustive structured program, each instruction is generated as a state, and the execution flow is executed based on a call stack. In particular, this means that loops in the execution flow will no longer cause code generation to fail.

Advanced verification with CrocoPat is also provided as an _experimental_ feature plugin. Currently this only detects [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/branches/2009-08-owl/org.openiaml.verification.crocopat/rules/infinite_redirection.rml?spec=svn1301&r=1301 infinite redirection loops].

==New Elements==

===Arithmetic===

Allows for inline arithmetic expressions.

  _See [http://openiaml.org/model/Arithmetic]_

==Changes==

[http://openiaml.org/model/ExecutionEdge ExecutionEdges] can now have names; a [[http://openiaml.org/model/DecisionCondition DecisionCondition] will use the labels 'yes' or 'no' (also 'pass' or 'fail') in order to calculate the correct execution flow.

All [ApplicationElementProperty]s now also create a condition called "X is set" in the container for the property. This is used in [SyncWires] to ensure that init/access does not overwrite the default (or existing) value if there is no value to replace it with. This is powered by a new [IamlDecisionConditions decision condition] "is set?"

Added documentation on [IamlDecisionConditions].

=Model 0.4.2=

*Released [http://journals.jevon.org/users/jevon-phd/entry/19798 February 2010]*

This minor release adds the concept of Entry Gates and Exit Gates, preventing access inside or outside a session without first co-operating with a given requirement (currently only other pages). [url=http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1497/trunk/examples/GateDisclaimer/GateDisclaimer-4.html]This example[/url] demonstrates using an Entry Gate to prevent viewing pages until a disclaimer page has been viewed; and [url=http://iaml.googlecode.com/svn-history/r1497/trunk/examples/ExitGateAdSimple/ExitGateAdSimple-1.html]this example[/url] illustrates an advertisement being displayed before the user can exit out of the session.

Conditional modelling is now also generated into code the same way as operational modelling in [#Model_0.4.1 0.4.1].

==New Elements==

===EntryGate===

Restricts access within a [http://openiaml.org/model/Scope Scope] until the incoming condition has been satisfied.

  _See [http://openiaml.org/model/EntryGate]_

===ExitGate===

Restricts access outside of a currently-visited [http://openiaml.org/model/Scope Scope] until the incoming condition has been satisfied.

  _See [http://openiaml.org/model/ExitGate]_

==Changes==

*Pages* have been renamed into [http://openiaml.org/model/Frame Frames]. In the future, this will allow Frames to recursively contain other Frames, which may be replaced using particular [http://openiaml.org/model/WireEdge wires] (the exact specifics have not been decided yet).

=Model 0.4.3=

  _Currently under development._

==New Elements==

===Label===

Represents a label which cannot be edited by the user; however, the value of the label _can_ change at runtime, by changing the Label.fieldValue.

  _See [http://openiaml.org/model/Label]_

==Changes==

A [http://openiaml.org/model/SetWire SetWire] connecting from a [http://openiaml.org/model/DomainObjectInstance DomainObjectInstance] to a [http://openiaml.org/model/InputForm InputForm] will now generate [http://openiaml.org/model/Label Labels]; compare this to [http://openiaml.org/model/SyncWire SyncWires] creating [http://openiaml.org/model/InputTextField InputTextFields].

[http://openiaml.org/model/DomainObjectInstance DomainObjectInstance].autosave and [http://openiaml.org/model/DomainAttributeInstance DomainAttributeInstance].autosave now default to "false".

ParameterWires are now known as [http://openiaml.org/model/ParameterEdge ParameterEdges]. They are no longer [http://openiaml.org/model/Wire Wires].
