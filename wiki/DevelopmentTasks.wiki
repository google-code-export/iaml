This page will ideally have information on how to achieve various common development tasks.

==Adding a new model element==

  # Define what the model element will help achieve
  # Add the model element to the .ecore
    # Regenerate model, edit code
    # Run test cases to ensure model structure is still valid
  # Add *runtime* test cases to identify what the new element will do
    # First, add runtime test cases (_.tests.codegen_)
    # Add test cases to CodegenTestsSuite
  # Add the model element to graphical editors
    # Edit .gmfgraph, .gmfmap, .gmfgen (where necessary)
    # Regenerate editors and re-run test cases
  # Using these new editors, create the sample models for the *runtime* test cases above
  # Add *inference* test cases (_.tests.inference_)
  # Add inference rules (_.drools_) to satisfy the *inference* test cases
  # Modify OAW code generation rules to satisfy the *runtime* test cases

Other development tasks still to document:

  # Creating a new graphical editor
  # Model migration: creating new model versions
