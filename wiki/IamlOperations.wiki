=Introduction=

In IAML, there are two types of operations: *Primitive* operations, and *Composite* operations.

*[IamlPrimitiveOperations Primitive Operations]* are the fundamental building blocks of application functionality.

*[IamlCompositeOperations Composite Operations]* are built up with a combination of primitive operations, decisions, branching and loops. 

In particular, primitive operations have a fixed semantics and cannot be changed (without modifying IAML inference and code generation logic); whereas composite operations have a default semantics, but can be [ModelInference changed if necessary].
