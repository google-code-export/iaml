=Introduction=

This model version adds real support for persistency (Properties files and databases), support for sessions, and complex components for login/logout.

The rest of the release provides more robust components, with model quality tests, release tests, and improved user interfaces with icons and breadcrumbs.

=Elements=

  * *Session*: an abstract representation of a "Session". Any ApplicationElementProperties stored in this session will not be available outside of the current user.
  * *AbstractDomainObject*: DomainObjects are abstracted away, and we now have DomainObject for SimpleDB databases, and FileDomainObject for .properties files.
  * *LoginHandler*: a component which deals with login/logout. Must be placed in a Session.

(More accurate documentation on these elements is required.)
