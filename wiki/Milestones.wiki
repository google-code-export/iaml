#summary Planned development milestones for the IAML plugin
#labels Featured,Phase-QA

=Introduction=
The development of this [Development IAML Eclipse plugin] is based on an iterative approach. In particular, large iterations (minor versions) which are then broken down into smaller iterations (revisions, spikes). These iterations are also designed to be synchronised with my [http://journals.jevon.org/users/jevon-phd PhD]. 

I hope to also use [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDrivenDevelopment Test Driven Development] significantly in order to test and validate the majority of the plugin. Though I'm not yet sure how to test the usability of Eclipse :)
