=Introduction=

Platform-specific project properties can be specified in an IAML project; a detailed editor will be provided with [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=87 issue 87].

The creation of these properties will be detailed later, but essentially an "iaml.properties" file in the same folder as the "model.iaml" model will be read at generation time.

==include_runtime==

If this is set to *true* (the default), the runtime libraries will be included directly in the generated code output. It will also modify _config_runtime_ and _config_web_ properties to reflect these new properties.

This was added in [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=81 issue 81] and implemented in the extension [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/browse/trunk/org.openiaml.model.codegen.oaw/src/org/openiaml/model/codegen/oaw/OawCodeGeneratorWithRuntime.java?spec=svn889&r=889 OawCodeGeneratorWithRuntime.java].

==config_runtime==

A string pointing to the server-side runtime libraries: [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=75 issue 75]. This is implemented at runtime by creating a _config.php_ configuration file at runtime, and referencing it as follows ([http://code.google.com/p/iaml/source/detail?r=894 example]):

{{{
<?php require(IAML_RUNTIME_ROOT."global.php"); ?>
}}}

==config_web==

A string pointing to the client-side runtime libraries: [http://code.google.com/p/iaml/issues/detail?id=76 issue 76]. This is implemented at runtime through:

{{{
<script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript" src="<?php echo IAML_RUNTIME_WEB; ?>js/default.js"></script>
}}}

==debug==

If set to "true", debug information will be rendered as part of the generate code. Until issue 137 is resolved, this only affects the rendering of debug code; it is still generated, just not displayed.

{{{
<?php if (DEBUG) { ... } ?>
}}}
